after line #3 can function as an introduction or explanation (like a manual) for your code in this specific repo.


After line #5, please summarize what you have learnt about repos
I've learnt that repos are places where you can store your code so that you can access it even if something goes wrong with the code you are working on. You can take/pull a version of your code and change it to something else, this is called forking.
